Since the turn of the century, freedom has proven itself to be a failed and outdated concept. In this day and age, the only way we will ever be able to compete with the United States or China is by adapting to fit their restrictive lifestyles.</p><p>The ACTA will save Europe from the scourge of democracy, which puts the making of laws in the hands of citizens, rather than powerful greedy corporations. As we have seen by the immense success that this last decadeâ€™s rule by global corporations has brought us, citizens are rather incapable of deciding their own fates. We will never be able to understand our own needs nearly as well as the corporate elite does.</p><p>Therefore, we the people demand that we shall not have to tolerate the evils of freedom any longer. Please vote for ACTA and take away all of our rights.</p><p><i>[This petition (probably) approved by the RIAA, MPAA, Time Warner, Sony, Microsoft, the American NSA, and the Ghost of Josef Stalin himself.]</i></p>";
